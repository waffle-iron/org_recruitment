# Welcome to the Green IT Globe Recruitment Repo

Objective is to provide our GIG teams with: 
* recruitment process to fill new positions
* templates to complete job descriptions (Wiki)
* provide overview of outstanding positions (Issues)

Please follow this easy and short process as following:

* Make request for job position using the Telegram channels to inform stakeholders
* Create and new Issue in this repo and document the position using the job description template
* Track the recruitment activity progress - in future we could even use Waffle
